Project: This study explores the implementation of deep learning techniques for autonomous steering angle prediction using the NVIDIA model architecture. We developed and evaluated multiple approaches, including hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation, to create a robust model capable of predicting steering angles from visual input. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen architecture, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.84 degrees on the test set. The study highlights the importance of data augmentation and model optimization in improving prediction accuracy for autonomous driving applications.
