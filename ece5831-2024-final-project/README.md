Project Description: This study explores the implementation of deep learning techniques for autonomous steering angle prediction using the NVIDIA model architecture. We developed and evaluated multiple approaches, including hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation, to create a robust model capable of predicting steering angles from visual input. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen architecture, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.84 degrees on the test set. The study highlights the importance of data augmentation and model optimization in improving prediction accuracy for autonomous driving applications.  

final_project.ipynb: This file is the main project, we showed all our work including data pre-processing, data augmentation, hyperparameters tuning, training the model, defining the prediction function, and model evaluation.  

Graph_predictions.ipynb: This file displays graphs of the actual angle vs predicted angle using our model.  

visualizations.ipynb: This file shows how the model would work in real-life situations, just for demonstration.

We had to make three different files because of the computational limitations, main project is under final_project.ipynb.
